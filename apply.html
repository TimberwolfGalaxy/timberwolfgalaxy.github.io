        <h2>Builder</h2>
        <h3>Builders are probably the sole most important job on this server, and therefore, we are the most picky about getting the best, and only the best. Previous staff experience is very helpful to your application, however we are open to accepting first-time workers as well.</h3>
        <h2>Moderator</h2>
        <h3>You must already be staff on Timberwolf Galaxy to get this job. Moderators keep the chat safe and friendly for everyone. You will be a living symbol of the rules.</h3>
        <h2>Developer</h2>
        <h3>Developers must show proof of their code, and will be recruited into the plugin development team. Mods are managed by Husky_Kibibyte only. Exceptions can be made about letting people into mod work.</h3>
        <h2>Modeller</h2>
        <h3>Modellers help the builders by making block models for new blocks. You must be able to creatively bring their ideas into as less blocks as possible.</h3>
        <h2>Professor/Trainer</h2>
        <h3>You will be teachers of magic and animal trainers. Trainer role requires you to have bought an animal.</h3>
